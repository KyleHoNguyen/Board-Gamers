# Board-Gamers
COP3530 Final Project
The COP3530FINALPROJECT folder shows our initial boardGame file, sorting file, and our main that holds our command line GUI. 
The GuiAttempt folder shows the Dear ImGui library which holds our executable. 
(To find executable FINALPROJECT\example_win32_directx11\Release\example_win32_directx11.exe) 
(To find main FINALPROJECT\example_win32_directx11\main.cpp)
This is our progress/attempt on creating a GUI using tthe Dear ImGui library.
As you can see there are three columns. The first column consists of questions that are used to help delete/filter unwanted
board games from our big dataset. It uses the int input text widget for the number of players and combo button widgets for the rest
of the filtering questions.

This next image shows the GUI after selecting each option and selecting a sort. The second column shows that the sort was able to run and showed 
the time it took for the sort function to run. It however was not able to show the actual top ten list of the board games vector as intended.

The third column was supposed to be a column that shows the individual stats of each board game whenever a corresponding button is pressed.
